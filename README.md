# Blackjack 

Blackjack simulation code used to replicate the tables and odds from "Beat The Dealer"

**NOTE** first version of code imported into this repository is from code originally written in ~2006.  
I have made some minor fixes and clean ups as I tried to re-figure out what I was doing.  Posted here for sharing w/friends.

* 'Card/Card' static library
* 'Odds/Odds' console app for generating the outcome tables similar thooe published in Beat The Dealer
  * **NOTE** The 'Double' and 'Split' tables line up with the book's values.  The 'Hit'/'Stand' tables do not currently, it looks like I was investigating strategies when I left off back in 2006 and did not restore.
* 'Deal/Deal' console app for investigating odds of similar shuffles
* 'Random/Random' console app
  * TBD - has some compile issues still
