Blackjack simulation code used to replicate the tables and odds from "Beat The Dealer"

**NOTE** originally written 2006 and posted here for sharing w/friends

* 'Card/Card' static library
* 'Odds/Odds' console app for generating the outcome tables
* 'Deal/Deal' console app for investigating odds of similar shuffles
* 'Random/Random' console app
  * TBD - has some compile issues still
